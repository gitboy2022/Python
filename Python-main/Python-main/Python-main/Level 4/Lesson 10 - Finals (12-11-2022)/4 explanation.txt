# 4 explaination

the sort will turn a list into 2 lists
1 normal list and 1 sorted list

and if the list[a] has the negative a
then it will print the sorted list in the print
or else it will print a normal list in it

if the explanation is wrong then
ignore it this is just a
possible explanation :)
